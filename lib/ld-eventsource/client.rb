module SSE
  #
  # A lightweight SSE client implementation. The client uses a worker thread to read from the
  # streaming HTTP connection. Events are dispatched from the same worker thread.
  #
  # The client will attempt to recover from connection failures as follows:
  #
  # * The first time the connection is dropped, it will wait about one second (or whatever value is
  # specified for `reconnect_time`) before attempting to reconnect. The actual delay has a
  # pseudo-random jitter value added.
  # * If the connection fails again within the time range specified by `reconnect_reset_interval`,
  # it will exponentially increase the delay between attempts (and also apply a random jitter).
  # However, if the connection stays up for at least that amount of time, the delay will be reset
  # to the minimum.
  # * Each time a new connection is made, the client will send a `Last-Event-Id` header so the server
  # can pick up where it left off (if the server has been sending ID values for events).
  #
  # It is also possible to force the connection to be restarted if the server sends no data within an
  # interval specified by `read_timeout`. Using a read timeout is advisable because otherwise it is
  # possible in some circumstances for a connection failure to go undetected. To keep the connection
  # from timing out if there are no events to send, the server could send a comment line (`":"`) at
  # regular intervals as a heartbeat.
  #

    # Creates a new SSE client.
    #
    # Once the client is created, it immediately attempts to open the SSE connection. You will
    # normally want to register your event handler before this happens, so that no events are missed.
    # To do this, provide a block after the constructor; the block will be executed before opening
    # the connection.
    #
    # @example Specifying an event handler at initialization time

    #   connection, in seconds
    # @param read_timeout [Float] (DEFAULT_READ_TIMEOUT)  the connection will be dropped and

    #   after a failure, in seconds; this can increase as described in {Client}
    # @param reconnect_reset_interval [Float] (DEFAULT_RECONNECT_RESET_INTERVAL)  if a connection
    #   stays alive for at least this number of seconds, the reconnect interval will return to the
    #   initial value

    #   defaults to a logger with WARN level that goes to standard output
    # @param socket_factory [#open] (nil)  an optional factory object for creating sockets,
